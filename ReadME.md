   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to start the application:
     ```
     java -jar assessment-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```

### Configuration Options:
- Database Connection:
   - Modify the database connection properties in the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory to configure the database connection settings.

### Interacting with the Project:
- **API Endpoints:**
   - The project exposes the following endpoints:

      - **GET /api/v1/deals:**
         - Description: Checks if the application is up and running.
         - Authorization: No authorization required.
         - Response: Returns a string message indicating the status of the application.

      - **POST /api/v1/deals:**
         - Description: Saves FX deal details into the database.
         - Authorization: No authorization required.
         - Request Body: The payload should be a JSON object with the following fields:
            - `dealUniqueId`: String (Unique identifier for the FX deal)
            - `orderingCurrencyISOCode`: String (ISO code for the ordering currency)
            - `toCurrencyISOCode`: String (ISO code for the target currency)
            - `amount`: BigDecimal (Amount of the FX deal)
         - Response: Returns a ResponseEntity with a BaseResponse containing the result of the operation. If successful, returns a success message; otherwise, returns validation errors or exceptions caught during processing.

### Sample Request Payload:

{
    "dealUniqueId": "SM_061",
    "orderingCurrencyISOCode": "GBP",
    "toCurrencyISOCode": "EUR",
    "amount": 2045876.35
}
```
## Testing Instructions:

### Description of Testing Tools and Frameworks:
- The project uses JUnit and Mockito for writing and executing automated tests.
  - **JUnit:** JUnit is a popular Java testing framework used for writing unit tests.
  - **Mockito:** Mockito is a mocking framework that allows for the creation of mock objects to simulate dependencies during testing.

### Instructions for Running Automated Tests:
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory to the root directory of the project.

2. **Run the Tests:**
   - Execute the following command to run the automated tests:
     ```
     mvn test
     ```

3. **View Test Results:**
   - After running the tests, review the test results displayed in the terminal.
   - Any failures or errors encountered during the test execution will be highlighted, along with the corresponding stack trace.

### Example Test Cases:
- Below are some example test cases written for the project:

  1. **testSaveDeals_UniqueDeal_Success:**
     - Description: Tests the successful saving of a unique FX deal.
     - Expected Outcome: The deal should be saved successfully, and the response should indicate success with the appropriate data.

  2. **testSaveDeals_DuplicateDeal_Failure:**
     - Description: Tests the scenario where a duplicate FX deal is encountered.
     - Expected Outcome: The operation should fail, and the response should indicate the presence of a duplicate deal.

  3. **testSaveDeals_InternalError_Failure:**
     - Description: Tests the scenario where an internal error occurs during the saving of an FX deal.
     - Expected Outcome: The operation should fail, and the response should indicate an internal error with an appropriate error message.
